# ros_gz_bridge parameter_bridge configuration
# Only bridge the topics we actually need (no magnetometer or air-pressure).
# Usage:
#   ros2 run ros_gz_bridge parameter_bridge --ros-args -p config_file:=${THIS_FILE_PATH}
#
# Notes:
# - GZ topics are fully qualified; keep them in sync with your world/model names.
# - Direction options: BIDIRECTIONAL, GZ_TO_ROS, ROS_TO_GZ.
