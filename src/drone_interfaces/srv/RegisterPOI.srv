# Called by a drone's ArUco detector to register a sighting with the
# central POI manager. The manager deduplicates (same tag seen multiple times)
# and returns whether this is a new discovery or an update.

# === REQUEST (detector → poi_manager) ===
uint32 tag_id
geometry_msgs/PoseStamped world_pose
float32 confidence
string detected_by
---
# === RESPONSE (poi_manager → detector) ===
bool is_new                            # true = first time seeing this tag_id
uint32 total_tags_found                # Running count of unique tags discovered
