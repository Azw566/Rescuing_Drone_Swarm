# AssignFrontier.srv
#
# Called by the coordinator to tell a drone "go explore this frontier".
# Services are synchronous request-response (unlike topics which are fire-and-forget).
#
# Why a service and not a topic?
# Because we need confirmation: did the drone accept the goal?
# If it's busy avoiding a collision, it might reject.

# === REQUEST (coordinator → drone) ===
string drone_id                        # Which drone to assign
geometry_msgs/Point frontier_centroid  # Where to go
---
# === RESPONSE (drone → coordinator) ===
bool accepted                          # true = "on my way", false = "can't right now"
string reason                          # If rejected: "avoiding_collision", "low_battery", etc.
